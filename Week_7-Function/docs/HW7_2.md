# Assignment 7.2 : GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
### Problem
In this assignment, you will write a C program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is the largest number that divides both integers without leaving a remainder.

### Requirements

1. **Input:**
- The user will input two positive integers.

2. **Calculate GCD:**

- The program will use the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and assigns the remainder to the larger number until the remainder is zero. The non-zero number at the end is the GCD.

3. **Edge Cases:**

- Handle cases such as when one or both numbers are zero (the GCD of zero and any number is the non-zero number).
- Ensure that the program works for equal numbers.

**This problem has to be solve using the function. If the code submited is not using function, your score will be deducted by 50% of your submitted code score.**

### Steps
1. **Input:**

- Prompt the user to enter two integers.
2. **Output:**

- Print the GCD of the two numbers.

### Input
- The first line contains the first integer, a.
- The second line contains the second integer, b.
### Output
- Print "The GCD of X and Y is Z" where X and Y are the input integers and Z is their GCD.

### Example

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 48 <br /> 18  | The GCD of 48 and 18 is 6 |

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 101 <br /> 103 | The GCD of 101 and 103 is 1 |
