### Problem
Create an `int` function that sum up all numbers between the given range that are divisible by the divisor `(i.e., where number % divisor == 0)` and return value to the main function.


### Input and Output Example

**Input:**
1. First line: The start number `(-2,147,483,646 ≤ start ≤ 2,147,483,647)`.
2. Second line: The end number `(end ≥ start)`.
3. Third line: The divisor `(2 ≤ divisor ≤ 10000)`.

**Output:**
The sum of all numbers divisible by the divisor between the start and end numbers

## Example test cases
| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1 <br /> 100 <br /> 2 | 2550 |
| 10 <br /> 10 <br /> 3 | 0 |
| -10 <br /> -1 <br /> 3 | -18 |

This problem has to be solved using the function. If the code submited is not using function, your score will be deducted by 50% of your given score.
