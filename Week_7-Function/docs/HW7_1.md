# Assignment 7.1: Armstrong Number Checker
### Problem
In this assignment, you will write a C program that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

### What is Armstrong Number?
An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. <br>
For a number with 𝑛 digits, an Armstrong number satisfies this condition:
**Armstrong number = (d<sub>1</sub> ​)<sup>n</sup> +(d<sub>2</sub> ​)<sup>n</sup> +⋯+(d<sub>n</sub> ​)<sup>n</sup>**
where d<sub>1</sub> ,  d<sub>2</sub> , … ,  d<sub>n</sub>​ are the digits of the number.

- Example: 153 is a Armstrong number because **1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 153**


### Requirements

1. **Input:**
- The user will input a single integer.
- The number can be any positive integer.

2. **Check for Armstrong Number:**

- The program will calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
- Compare the calculated sum with the original number to check if it is an Armstrong number.

3. **Edge Cases:**

- Handle cases such as single-digit numbers (all single-digit numbers are Armstrong numbers).
- In case user inputs negative value, prints **"Armstrong Number cannot be negative"**

**This problem has to be solve using the function. If the code submited is not using function, your score will be deducted by 50% of your submited code score.**

### Steps
1. **Input:**

- Prompt the user to enter an integer.
2. **Output:**

- Print whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.

### Input
- The first line contains a single integer, n.
### Output
- Print "n is an Armstrong number" if n is an Armstrong number.
- Print "n is not an Armstrong number" if n is not an Armstrong number.
- Print "Armstrong Number cannot be negative" if n is negative

### Example

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 153  | 153 is an Armstrong number |

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 123 | 123 is not an Armstrong number |
