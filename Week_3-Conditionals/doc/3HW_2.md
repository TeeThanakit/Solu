### Assignment 3.2: Complex Pricing System with Discounts and Tax

### Problem

You are tasked with developing a pricing system that calculates the final price of a product after applying relevant discounts and taxes. The system needs to account for different types of products and promotions.

The system should follow these rules:

1. **Product Types**:
    - **Type 1**: Electronics
    - **Type 2**: Clothing
    - **Type 3**: General Goods

2. **Promotions**:
    - If a promotion is available (`has_promotion = 1`):
        - **For Electronics and Clothing**:
            - If the price is **5000 Baht or more**, apply a **25% discount** (20% base discount + 5% additional promotion).
            - If the price is **2000 Baht or more but less than 5000 Baht**, apply a **15% discount** (10% base discount + 5% additional promotion).
            - If the price is **less than 2000 Baht**, apply a **10% discount** (5% base discount + 5% additional promotion).
        - **For General Goods**:
            - If the price is **5000 Baht or more**, apply a **20% discount**.
            - If the price is **2000 Baht or more but less than 5000 Baht**, apply a **10% discount**.
            - If the price is **less than 2000 Baht**, apply a **5% discount**.
    - If there is no promotion (`has_promotion = 0`), the price remains unchanged.

3. **Tax**:
    - After applying the discount (if any), a **7% VAT** (Value Added Tax) is applied to the final price.

4. **Final Output**:
    - The program should calculate and display the **net price** after applying the discount and tax.

### Input

The input consists of three lines:
- **First line**: A float representing the price of the product (positive float).
- **Second line**: An integer representing whether a promotion is available (`1` for yes, `0` for no).
- **Third line**: An integer representing the product type (`1` for Electronics, `2` for Clothing, `3` for General Goods).

### Output

The output is a single line:
- The net price after applying the discount (if applicable) and tax, formatted to two decimal places.

### Example

| Input                  | Output                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| 6000.00 <br> 1 <br> 1  | Net price after discount and tax: 4815.00 Baht |
| 2500.00 <br> 1 <br> 2  | Net price after discount and tax: 2273.75 Baht |
| 1800.00 <br> 1 <br> 3  | Net price after discount and tax: 1829.70 Baht |
| 4000.00 <br> 0 <br> 2  | Net price after discount and tax: 4280.00 Baht |
| 1826.4567 <br> 1 <br> 3  | Net price after discount and tax: 1856.59 Baht |

### Explanation

1. **Case 1**: 
    - Product: Electronics, Price: 6000.00 Baht, Promotion: Yes
    - Discount: 25% (20% base + 5% additional)
    - Price after discount: 4500.00 Baht
    - Price after tax: 4815.00 Baht

2. **Case 2**: 
    - Product: Clothing, Price: 2500.00 Baht, Promotion: Yes
    - Discount: 15% (10% base + 5% additional)
    - Price after discount: 2125.00 Baht
    - Price after tax: 2273.75 Baht

3. **Case 3**: 
    - Product: General Goods, Price: 1800.00 Baht, Promotion: Yes
    - Discount: 5%
    - Price after discount: 1710.00 Baht
    - Price after tax: 1829.70 Baht

4. **Case 4**: 
    - Product: Clothing, Price: 4000.00 Baht, Promotion: No
    - No discount applied
    - Price after tax: 4280.00 Baht

5. **Case 5**: 
    - Product: General Goods, Price: 1826.4567 Baht, Promotion: Yes
    - Discount: 5%
    - Price after discount: 1735.13 Baht
    - Price after tax: 1856.59 Baht

This exercise helps to understand how to implement conditional logic with multiple nested `if-else` statements, while also managing arithmetic operations such as applying discounts and taxes to a base price.
