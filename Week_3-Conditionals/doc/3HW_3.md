# Assignment 3.3: Grade Calculation System

### Problem

You are tasked with creating a program that calculates the final grade of a student based on their total score. The grading system follows a set of rules to assign letter grades based on the score, which is an integer between 0 and 100.

The system should follow these rules:

#### Grade Scale:
- **A**: 90 - 100
- **B+**: 85 - 89
- **B**: 80 - 84
- **C+**: 75 - 79
- **C**: 70 - 74
- **D+**: 65 - 69
- **D**: 60 - 64
- **F**: Below 60

#### Input Validation:
- If the score is not within the range of 0 to 100, the program should display an error message: `"Invalid score!"`

#### Final Output:
- The program should output the letter grade corresponding to the student's score.

### Input

The input consists of one line:
- **First line**: An integer representing the student's score (0 ≤ score ≤ 100).

### Output

The output is a single line:
- The letter grade corresponding to the student's score or an error message if the score is out of range.

### Example

| Input | Output           |
|-------|------------------|
| 92.2    | A                |
| 81.55    | B               |
| 79    | C+               |
| 67    | D+               |
| 105.2   | Invalid score!   |
| -5    | Invalid score!   |

### Explanation

1. **Case 1**:
    - Score: 92.2
    - The score falls within the range for grade **A** (90-100).
    - Output: **A**

2. **Case 2**:
    - Score: 81.55
    - The score falls within the range for grade **B+** (85-89).
    - Output: **B**

3. **Case 3**:
    - Score: 79
    - The score falls within the range for grade **C+** (75-79).
    - Output: **C+**

4. **Case 4**:
    - Score: 67
    - The score falls within the range for grade **D+** (65-69).
    - Output: **D+**

5. **Case 5**:
    - Score: 105.2
    - The score is outside the valid range (0-100).
    - Output: **Invalid score!**

6. **Case 6**:
    - Score: -5
    - The score is outside the valid range (0-100).
    - Output: **Invalid score!**

This exercise helps to understand how to implement conditional logic with multiple `if-else` statements, as well as basic input validation.
