# Homework x: Array Input and Reversal in C

### Problem

In this assignment, you will write a C program that takes an array of integers as input from the user, prints the array, and then prints the array in reverse order.

### Requirements

1. **Array Input:**
   - The user will input `n` integers, where `n` is the size of the array.
   - Store the input values in an array.
   - In case, the user inputs an invalid value (negative value). Print out **"Invalid Input"** and exit the program immediately

2. **Print the Array:**
   - Print the array elements in the order they were entered.

3. **Print the Array in Reverse:**
   - After printing the array, print the elements in reverse order.

### Steps

1. **Input:**
   - First, prompt the user to enter the size of the array (`n`).
   - Then, ask the user to input `n` integers to fill the array.

2. **Output:**
   - Print the array in the order it was entered.
   - Print the array in reverse order.


### Input

- The first line contains a positive integer `n`, which is the size of the array.
- The second line contains `n` integers, which are the elements of the array.

### Output

- Print the array elements in the order they were entered on one line.
- Print the array elements in reverse order on the next line.


### Example

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 5 <br /> 10 20 30 40 50 | Array: 10 20 30 40 50 <br /> Reversed Array: 50 40 30 20 10 |

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 3 <br /> 7 9 11 | Array: 7 9 11 <br /> Reversed Array: 11 9 7 |
