# Homework x: Moving Zeros in an Array (Left or Right)

### Problem

In this assignment, you will write a C program that moves all zero values in an array either to the **left** or the **right**, based on a user-specified mode:
- **Mode 1:** Move all zeros to the left of the array.
- **Mode 2:** Move all zeros to the right of the array.

**The program should:**
1. Take the size of the array as input.
2. Accept the elements of the array from the user.
3. Accept a mode (1 or 2) from the user.
4. Modify the array by moving zeros according to the selected mode.
5. Print the modified array.


### Input

- The first line contains a positive integer `n`, which is the size of the array.
- The second line contains `n` integers, which are the elements of the array (including zeros).
- The third line contains the mode (either `1` or `2`).


### Output

- Print the modified array with all zeros moved either to the left or right, depending on the mode.
