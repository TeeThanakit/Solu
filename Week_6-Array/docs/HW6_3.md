# Assignment 3.2: Anagram Checker
### Problem
In this assignment, you will write a C program that checks if two input strings are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words or phrases made by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once while ignoring case, spaces, and special characters.

### Requirements

1. **String Input:**
- The user will input two strings.
- Ignore case, spaces, punctuation, and special characters (!@#"+-*&$).

2. **Check for Anagram:**

- Compare the two strings to determine if they are anagrams of each other.
- You can use either a character frequency counting method or sorting to verify if the strings are anagrams.

3. **Edge Cases:**

- Handle cases such as strings with different lengths (after ignoring spaces and special characters) or empty strings.
- Ensure that case sensitivity is ignored.

### Steps
1. **Input:**

- Prompt the user to enter the first and second strings.
2. **Output:**

- Print whether the two strings are anagrams or not.

### Input
- The first line contains the first string.
- The second line contains the second string.
### Output
- Print **"The strings are anagrams"** if the strings are anagrams.
- Print **"The strings are not anagrams"** if the strings are not anagrams.

### Example

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| Hello <br /> WorLD | The strings are not anagrams |

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| Dormitory <br /> Dirty room!! | The strings are anagrams |
