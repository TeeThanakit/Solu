# Homework x: Most Frequent Values in an Array

You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of elements in an array, followed by `n` integers. Your task is to determine the most frequent values in the array and their frequency.

**Input:**

- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains `n` integers, separated by spaces.

**Output:**

- If the array is empty (i.e., `n` ≤ 0), print `"Array is empty"`.
- Otherwise, print the most frequent value(s) and their frequency:
  - If there is only one most frequent value, print `"Most frequent value: X"`, where `X` is the most frequent value.
  - If there are multiple most frequent values, print `"Most frequent values: X1 X2 ... Xk"`, where `X1`, `X2`, ..., `Xk` are the most frequent values, separated by spaces.
  - Always print the frequency of the most frequent values as `"Frequency: F"`, where `F` is the frequency.

**Examples:**

| **Input**       | **Output**                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 7<br>1 2 2 3 3 3 4 | Most frequent value: 3<br>Frequency: 3 |
| 5<br>1 1 2 2 3 | Most frequent values: 1 2<br>Frequency: 2 |
| 10<br>1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 | Most frequent value: 4<br>Frequency: 4  |
| 5<br>5 5 4 4 3 | Most frequent value: 5 4<br>Frequency: 2  |
| 6<br>7 8 9 10 11 12 | Most frequent values: 7 8 9 10 11 12<br>Frequency: 1  |
| 0<br>         | Array is empty                               |

**Explanation:**

- **Case 1:** The array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]` has `3` as the most frequent value, appearing 3 times.
- **Case 2:** The array `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]` has both `1` and `2` as the most frequent values, each appearing 2 times.
- **Case 3:** The array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]` has `4` as the most frequent value, appearing 4 times.
- **Case 4:** The array `[5, 5, 4, 4, 3,]` has both `5` and `4` as the most frequent value, appearing 2 times.
- **Case 5:** The array `[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]` has each value appearing exactly once, so all values are listed as most frequent with a frequency of 1.
- **Case 6:** No elements are present in the array, so the output indicates that the array is empty.
