# Exam Question 3: Factorial Sum Table with Prime Check

### Problem

You are tasked with creating a program that generates a table based on the factorials of row and column indices. Each cell in the table will display the sum of the factorials of the corresponding row and column indices. If the sum is a prime number, the program should output the negative of the sum; otherwise, it should output the sum itself. The program must handle all calculations and checks using only `if-else` statements and loops, **with no functions, arrays, or matrices**.

The system should follow these rules:

#### Calculation Rules:

1. Compute the factorial of each row index and each column index.
2. Calculate the sum of the factorials of the row and column indices.
3. Check if the sum is a prime number.
4. Display the negative of the sum if it is a prime number; otherwise, display the sum.
5. **Do not use functions, arrays, or matrices** in the implementation.

#### Output Format:

- The program should output a table where each cell contains the processed sum based on the above rules.
- Each row of the table should be printed on a new line.

#### Hint:

- `int`: Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
- `long long`: Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
- `long long int`: Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

### Input

The input consists of two integers:

- **First line**: Number of rows.
- **Second line**: Number of columns.

### Output

The output consists of a table where each cell contains the result based on the factorial sum and prime check. The table should be formatted with tabs separating cells and new lines separating rows.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output**                                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4 4       | -2 -2 -3 -7<br/>-2 -2 -3 -7<br/>-3 -3 4 8<br/>-7 -7 8 12 |
| 3 2       | -2 -2<br/>-2 -2<br/>-3 -3                                |
| 2 3       | -2 -2 -3<br/>-2 -2 -3                                    |
| 1 1       | -2                                                       |

### Explanation

1. **Case 1**:

   - **Input**: `4 4`

   - For example:
     - **Cell (0, 0)**: \(0! + 0! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (0, 1)**: \(0! + 1! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (0, 2)**: \(0! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3\). Since 3 is a prime number, the output is `-3`.
     - **Cell (0, 3)**: \(0! + 3! = 1 + 6 = 7\). Since 7 is a prime number, the output is `-7`.
     - **Cell (1, 0)**: \(1! + 0! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (1, 1)**: \(1! + 1! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (1, 2)**: \(1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3\). Since 3 is a prime number, the output is `-3`.
     - **Cell (1, 3)**: \(1! + 3! = 1 + 6 = 7\). Since 7 is a prime number, the output is `-7`.
     - **Cell (2, 0)**: \(2! + 0! = 2 + 1 = 3\). Since 3 is a prime number, the output is `-3`.
     - **Cell (2, 1)**: \(2! + 1! = 2 + 1 = 3\). Since 3 is a prime number, the output is `-3`.
     - **Cell (2, 2)**: \(2! + 2! = 2 + 2 = 4\). Since 4 is not a prime number, the output is `4`.
     - **Cell (2, 3)**: \(2! + 3! = 2 + 6 = 8\). Since 8 is not a prime number, the output is `8`.
     - **Cell (3, 0)**: \(3! + 0! = 6 + 1 = 7\). Since 7 is a prime number, the output is `-7`.
     - **Cell (3, 1)**: \(3! + 1! = 6 + 1 = 7\). Since 7 is a prime number, the output is `-7`.
     - **Cell (3, 2)**: \(3! + 2! = 6 + 2 = 8\). Since 8 is not a prime number, the output is `8`.
     - **Cell (3, 3)**: \(3! + 3! = 6 + 6 = 12\). Since 12 is not a prime number, the output is `12`.
   - The resulting table with cells formatted as tab-separated values is:

   ```
   -2 -2 -3 -7
   -2 -2 -3 -7
   -3 -3 4 8
   -7 -7 8 12
   ```

2. **Case 2**:

   - **Input**: `3 2`
   - For example:
     - **Cell (0, 0)**: \(0! + 0! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (0, 1)**: \(0! + 1! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (1, 0)**: \(1! + 0! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (1, 1)**: \(1! + 1! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (2, 0)**: \(2! + 0! = 2 + 1 = 3\). Since 3 is a prime number, the output is `-3`.
     - **Cell (2, 1)**: \(2! + 1! = 2 + 1 = 3\). Since 3 is a prime number, the output is `-3`.
   - The resulting table with cells formatted as tab-separated values is:

   ```
   -2 -2
   -2 -2
   -3 -3
   ```

3. **Case 3**:

   - **Input**: `2 3`
   - For example:
     - **Cell (0, 0)**: \(0! + 0! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (0, 1)**: \(0! + 1! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (0, 2)**: \(0! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3\). Since 3 is a prime number, the output is `-3`.
     - **Cell (1, 0)**: \(1! + 0! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (1, 1)**: \(1! + 1! = 1 + 1 = 2\). Since 2 is a prime number, the output is `-2`.
     - **Cell (1, 2)**: \(1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3\). Since 3 is a prime number, the output is `-3`.
   - The resulting table with cells formatted as tab-separated values is:

   ```
   -2 -2 -3
   -2 -2 -3
   ```

### Notes:

- This code calculates the factorial of each row and column index, then checks if their sum is a prime number. The output is formatted as a table with tab-separated values and new lines.
- Ensure to test the code with various inputs to verify correctness and handle edge cases.
