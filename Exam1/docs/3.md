# Exam Question 2: Alphabetical Vertical Triangle

## Problem

Create a C program to create the Alphabetical Vertical Triangle by the size of user input

## Numeric Triangle

- The Numeric triangle referred to the patern of increment integer number from into the triangle
- The triangle is form by the increment from left to right in increment size in each row

#### For example:

**Size:** 3

```
1
2 3
4 5 6
```

The number start from 1 and start the increment from left to right by 1.

After it reach the size of that row which in this case it's size is 1, it will skip to the next row and start with 2 and so on.

## Numeric Vertical Triangle

- Similar to Numeric triangle but instead the increment start from top to bottom.

#### For example:

**Size:** 3

```
1
2 4
3 5 6
```

## Main Problem: Alphabetical Vertical Triangle

- By applying the Numeric Vertical Triangle order into the alphabetical order

#### For example:

**Size:** 3

```
a
b d
c e f
```

The order starting from `a` in lowercase and progress. If the increment is reach furtherthan `z`, the letter will change into uppercases starting from `A`

#### For example:

**Size:** 8

```
a
b i
c j p
d k q v
e l r w A
f m s x B E
g n t y C F H
h o u z D G I J
```

## Ascii Code

*Looking for the **Decimal** and **Char** Column*
