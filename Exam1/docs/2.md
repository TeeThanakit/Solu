# Exam Question 1: Perfect Number

## Problem
Create a C program to find all perfect numbers between 1 - **userInput**.

## What is a Perfect Number?
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

## Example
6 is a perfect number because the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

The proper divisors (excluding itself) are 1, 2, and 3.

The sum of these proper divisors is:

1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Since the sum of the proper divisors equals the number itself, 6 is a perfect number.

## Input
- One positive integer

## Output
- Perfect number(s)
- If no valid perfect numbers are provided, the output will be **"No perfect number."**

## Example test case

| Input | Output |
|:-----------|:------------:|
| 10  | 6  |
| 30 | 6<br>28 |
| 3 | No perfect number. |
