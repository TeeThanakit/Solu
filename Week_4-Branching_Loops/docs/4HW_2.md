# ðŸ“•Assignment 4.2: Hourglass Drawing

### Problem

Write a C program that dynamically generates an hourglass shape using only loops. The program should accept both odd and even numbers as input and adjust the hourglass shape accordingly.

### Requirements:

**Input:** The program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer n, which represents the size of the hourglass.
- If n is an even number, the hourglass should have its middle section consisting of two lines of stars.
- If n is an odd number, the hourglass should have a single line of stars in the middle.

**Output:** The program should print the hourglass shape using asterisks (*).
- The hourglass should be centered, with the widest part at the top and bottom, and the narrowest part in the middle.
- The upper part of the hourglass should start with n stars and reduce by 2 stars on each subsequent line.
- The lower part of the hourglass should start with either 2 or 3 stars (depending on whether n is even or odd) and increase by 2 stars on each line until it reaches n stars again.
- If the input is zero or lower, print out "The input is invalid"

### Input

The input consisting of 1 line:

- **First line:** 1 integer values (num) for height of the hourglass

### Output

The input consisting of num lines:

- A shape of glasshour with the height of num

### Example (PLS LOOK BELOW)

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 5 | ***** <br />&nbsp;*** <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br />&nbsp;*** <br /> ***** |
| 4 | **** <br />&nbsp;** <br />&nbsp;** <br /> **** |

### Fixed example
```
INPUT: 5 OUTPUT: *****
                  *** 
                   *
                  ***
                 *****

INPUT: 5 OUTPUT: ****
                  ** 
                  **
                 ****
```
