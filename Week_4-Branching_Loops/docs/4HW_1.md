# ðŸ“•Assignment 4.1: Enhanced ATM Machine

You are tasked with designing an ATM machine program that allows users to perform various banking operations. The machine provides a menu of options, and the user can choose what operation to perform. The operations include checking the balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the program.

## Menu Options (Input: 1 - 4 use switch case only!)
1. **Check Balance**: Display the current balance.
2. **Deposit Money**: Allow the user to add money to their account.
3. **Withdraw Money**: Allow the user to withdraw money from their account. Ensure the withdrawal amount does not exceed the current balance.
4. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Additional Requirements
- The program should continuously display the menu after completing an operation unless the user chooses to exit.
- If the user selects an invalid option from the menu, the program should display `"Invalid option!"` and prompt the user again.
- If the user attempts to withdraw more money than available in the balance, the program should display `"Insufficient funds!"` and prompt the user to choose another operation.
- The deposit and withdrawal amounts should be positive numbers. If a non-positive amount is entered, the program should display an error message: `"Invalid deposit amount!"` or `"Invalid withdrawal amount!"`.

## Input
The program continuously takes input as integers:

- **First line**: An integer representing the user's choice from the menu.
- If the user chooses to deposit or withdraw money, an additional floating-point number input will be required to specify the amount.

## Output
The program outputs messages based on the user's actions, including:

- The current balance after a deposit or withdrawal.
- Error messages for invalid inputs or operations.

## Input and Output for each line in every action (testcase below)

| 0      | Invalid withdrawal amount! |
| 3      |                           |
