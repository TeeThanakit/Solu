# ðŸ“•Assignment 4.4: Number Conversion

### Problem

Write a C program that converts a decimal number to binary, octal, or hexadecimal based on the user's choice. The program should use only loops and if-else statements for the conversion process, avoiding the use of arrays, or strings.

### Requirements:

**Input:**

The program should prompt the user to:
- Enter a positive integer (num) representing the decimal number.
- Select a conversion mode:
  - 1 for Binary
  - 2 for Octal
  - 3 for Hexadecimal

**Output:**

Based on the user's choice, the program should print the converted number in the selected base.
- **Binary Conversion:** The program should convert the decimal number to binary, outputting the binary digits directly without storing them.
- **Octal Conversion:** The program should convert the decimal number to octal, displaying the octal digits directly.
- **Hexadecimal Conversion:** The program should convert the decimal number to hexadecimal, using A to F for values 10 to 15, and print the hexadecimal digits.
- In case that the mode input is off the range, output **"Invalid Choice"**
### Input

The input consisting of 2 lines:
- **First line:** a zero or positive integer that represents the number to be converted
- **Second line:** a integer (from 1 to 3) that represents the mentioned mode


### Output

The input consisting of 1 line:

- **First line:** A positive converted integer

### Example

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 5 <br /> 1 | 101 |
| 255 <br /> 3 | FF|
